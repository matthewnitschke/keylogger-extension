# keylogger-extension
A terrible keylogger chrome extension.

This is what boredom creates.

# Installation

There are two parts. The chrome extension and the server

### Extension
1. Go to the chrome settings -> Extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the check box
3. Drag the extension folder from this repository into the chrome window

### Server
1. Create a new directory in your apache server
2. drag the server folders contents into the directory
3. make sure CORS is enabled on that directory

Once installed you should be ready to go. Keypresses will be logged in the logging.txt file
